/**
 * What a live-wallpaper engine is holding at this instant.
 *
 * Values are read straight off engine fields rather than accumulated by
 * acquire/release counters: a miscounted release would hide exactly the leak
 * this is meant to catch, so the report is derived from reality instead of from
 * a parallel tally that can drift.
 *
 * This matters more here than anywhere else in the app. A wallpaper process
 * outlives every other component - it survives launcher restarts and stays
 * resident for days - so an engine that keeps one extra player, posted frame
 * callback, sensor listener, segmenter, or decoded bitmap per surface cycle
 * accumulates them until the platform kills the process.
