# Provider Policy Matrix

This matrix is the human-readable companion to `ProviderDisclosure.kt`. The app
uses the code model to populate Settings > Open source licenses, and unit tests
fail when a `ContentSource` enum value lacks a disclosure row.

Runtime disablement and unavailable-source behavior are tracked separately in
[provider-runtime-controls.md](provider-runtime-controls.md). Release-runtime
dependency notice generation, native/copyleft packets, and item-level license
capability gates remain tracked in `ROADMAP.md`. Sound action capabilities are
documented in [sound-license-capabilities.md](sound-license-capabilities.md).
Community upload rights metadata is documented in
[community-upload-rights.md](community-upload-rights.md).
