# Aura Privacy Policy

Aura is an open-source Android personalization app for wallpapers, video
wallpapers, ringtones, sounds, and optional community uploads.

Aura has no ads, does not sell personal data, and does not use cross-app
tracking.

The release-reviewed manifest permission and Data safety matrix is tracked in
[`docs/privacy/data-safety.md`](data-safety.md).

## Account Model

Aura does not require an account for local browsing, downloaded content, local
favorites, or local wallpaper/sound tools. Community features can use an
anonymous Firebase identity when a user uploads, votes, follows, reports,
blocks, or manages creator/community data.

## Data Stored On The Device

- App preferences such as theme, provider switches, and scheduler settings.
- API keys entered by the user. These are kept in a separate encrypted store.
- Favorites, downloads, search history, wallpaper cache metadata, offline
  favorite files, edited sounds, generated wallpapers, and diagnostics created
  by explicit user action.
- Fit Canvas presentation choices, plus the active live-wallpaper video and its
  generated canvas or apply copy when Fit needs one.
- Rotation exclusions for wallpapers and videos. Aura stores provider IDs,
  content hashes, or one-way locator fingerprints instead of raw local paths.
- A local fallback community identity only when a local community identifier is
  needed.

Fit Canvas media and the app preference store are excluded from Android cloud
backup and device transfer. A portable library backup includes the non-secret
Fill or Fit choice, canvas mode, and chosen color so the same defaults can be
restored on another device. It does not include the active media file or a
generated canvas copy. The same portable backup can include rotation
exclusions, but it never includes a raw local path from those records.

User-entered provider API keys are encrypted with AES-GCM using a
non-exportable Android Keystore key. The encrypted SharedPreferences file and
the legacy preferences DataStore file are excluded from cloud backup and
device transfer. If restored ciphertext arrives without its device-bound key,
Aura removes the unreadable copy and asks the user to re-enter that key.
Temporary Keystore errors keep ciphertext for retry. Users can remove each
visible key with the Settings key dialog's Clear action or by saving a blank
value. Android clear-app-data or uninstall removes the encrypted store and its
app-owned key.

Provider credentials are not included in library backups, collection or
theme-pack exports, generated wallpaper reports, source diagnostics, or support
bundles. Diagnostics can report the credential storage state but never the key
name or value.

## Community Data

When community features are used, Aura can store community sound/wallpaper
metadata, upload ownership indexes, vote markers, follows, block rows, reports,
creator profile rows, collection shares, and moderation/deletion evidence in
Firebase services.

Public community upload metadata and uploaded media can be visible to other
users. Private moderation, rights, safety, abuse-prevention, report, and
deletion evidence is retained for operator review and is not public.

## Account Deletion

Users with Aura installed can open `Settings` > `Community identity` to view a
redacted identity suffix and an `AURA-` deletion request code when a Firebase
identity exists. The same panel includes `Clear local`, which removes only the
local fallback community identity from the current device.

Support deletion handling is documented in
[`docs/support/community-account-deletion.md`](../support/community-account-deletion.md).
The hosted web deletion request URL is pending owner publication before Play
production submission. The field contract is tracked in
[`docs/support/community-account-deletion-web-intake.md`](../support/community-account-deletion-web-intake.md),
publishable page copy is tracked in
[`docs/support/community-account-deletion-web-page.md`](../support/community-account-deletion-web-page.md),
and publication status is tracked in
[`docs/support/community-account-deletion-web-url.json`](../support/community-account-deletion-web-url.json).
The URL manifest must move from `pendingOwnerUrl` to `published` only after an
HTTPS deletion request URL is live and referenced from this policy and the
support intake document.

Backend deletion requests are routed through private operator tooling. Public
uploads, Storage objects, Firebase Authentication deletion, local device cleanup,
and retained moderation evidence have separate steps so deletion does not leave
orphaned public data or remove private safety records out of sequence.

## Diagnostics

Aura does not use automatic crash analytics. Settings exposes a local crash
diagnostics bundle that a user can copy or share manually. The bundle is
sanitized before sharing and does not upload itself automatically.

## Third-Party Services

Aura can fetch content or metadata from configured providers such as Wallhaven,
Pexels, Pixabay, Reddit, YouTube tooling, Open-Meteo, Firebase, and optional
Stability image generation. Provider usage depends on enabled features,
provider switches, and user actions.

Generated wallpaper prompts are sent to Stability only after the user reviews
and accepts the in-app disclosure. The generated wallpaper privacy runbook is
tracked in [`docs/privacy/ai-generation.md`](ai-generation.md).

New saved generated wallpaper favorites use generic names and non-prompt tags;
Aura does not copy prompt words into favorite names or tags by default.
Removing a saved generated wallpaper also removes its app-private generated PNG
after the Undo window closes.

Generated wallpaper reports use Aura's private Firebase-backed report queue and
do not include Stability keys, other provider keys, local generated-image file
paths, or prompt text unless the user writes prompt text in the report note.

## Contact

Use the project support channel or issue tracker for questions. Do not publish
full Firebase UIDs, access tokens, private database exports, or raw deletion
request form exports in public issues.
