# Supply-chain verification

Aura is side-loaded through GitHub Releases and Obtainium, so release artifacts
need locally reproducible evidence before publication. GitHub hosts the checked
release files; local tooling is the source of truth for build, notice, native,
checksum, and release-note validation.

## Active controls

| Control | Local source | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Signed release APK | `.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleFullRelease --stacktrace --no-daemon` | Builds the non-debuggable GitHub/Obtainium release variant with local signing inputs. |
| Signed Play AAB | `.\gradlew.bat :app:bundleFullRelease --stacktrace --no-daemon` | Builds the Play-ready app bundle for the same version and upload key. |
| Release bundle validator | `tools/release_artifact_bundle_check.py` | Fails dry runs when the final APK/AAB/notices/native/checksum/release-note bundle is incomplete or internally inconsistent. |

| Cleartext release guard | `tools/cleartext_release_check.py` | Rejects cleartext manifest/network drift in public releases. |
| Network endpoint inventory | `tools/network_endpoint_inventory_check.py` | Fails when provider network-code hosts drift from the reviewed endpoint inventory. |
| Store metadata preflight | `tools/store_metadata_preflight.py` | Checks Fastlane text limits, current changelog, branding, and privacy-policy URL. |
| Store asset pipeline | `tools/store_asset_pipeline_check.py` | Checks screenshot/feature-graphic planning, Fastlane image paths, alt text, and future asset-mode command. |
| Privacy policy link gate | `tools/privacy_policy_link_check.py` | Keeps Settings, Fastlane metadata, README, and release dry-run docs aligned to the public privacy-policy URL. |

| F-Droid blocker preflight | `tools/fdroid_preflight.py` | Confirms that the mainline full build remains blocked from F-Droid until proprietary dependency boundaries change. |

## Release verification

For each `v*` release:

1. Build the signed release APK locally and name it `Aura-vX.Y.Z-versionCode-N-universal-release.apk`.
2. Build the signed release AAB locally and name it `Aura-vX.Y.Z-versionCode-N-play-release.aab`.
3. Generate and inspect `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.
4. Generate and inspect `GOOGLE-OSS-RAW-INPUTS.zip`; this archive is retained with every public release under [raw-oss-input-retention.md](raw-oss-input-retention.md).
5. Generate and inspect `NATIVE-COMPLIANCE.md`.
6. Generate and inspect `NATIVE-ALIGNMENT.json`.
7. Write `apksigner.txt` from `apksigner verify --verbose --print-certs`.
8. Write `aapt-badging.txt` from `aapt dump badging` and confirm it does not report `application-debuggable`.
9. Write `aab-manifest.txt`, `bundletool-validate.txt`, `aab-jarsigner.txt`, `aab-keytool.txt`, and `PLAY-APP-SIGNING-OWNER-STEPS.txt` from the Play AAB validation commands.
10. Write `SHA256SUMS.txt` with digests for the APK, AAB, notices, raw Google OSS archive, native compliance packet, and native alignment packet.
11. Write `RELEASE_NOTES.md` with the APK SHA-256, AAB SHA-256, third-party notice entry, raw Google OSS input archive entry, native compliance packet entry, native alignment packet entry, signing certificate SHA-256, upload-key SHA-256, Play App Signing owner steps, local build receipt, package ID, and release build type.
12. Run `tools/release_artifact_bundle_check.py` against the final release directory.
13. Upload the checked files with `gh release create` or `gh release upload --clobber`.
14. Compare the GitHub Release assets to local `SHA256SUMS.txt` after upload.

```

## Release dry runs

Release dry runs are local. They build the signed release APK and Play-ready
AAB, generate third-party notices, archive raw Google OSS inputs, generate the
native compliance and alignment packets, run lock/overlay/license gates, produce
checksums and release notes, and validate the final bundle before anything is
uploaded to GitHub.

Procedure: [release-dry-run.md](release-dry-run.md).

## GitHub workflow policy

Aura's current distribution policy is local builds only. The policy JSON files
under `docs/distribution/github-*.json` intentionally contain empty required
workflow sets. The matching Python checks pass when `.github/workflows` is
absent and fail if workflow files, workflow permissions, workflow secrets, or
security workflow controls are reintroduced without updating the policy in the
same change.

## Third-party notices

Google's OSS Licenses Gradle task is the release notice input. Aura does not add
the `play-services-oss-licenses` runtime dependency or stock Google notice
activity because that runtime path pulls broad UI dependency upgrades on the
current AGP 8.9.3 / Gradle 8.12 stack.

Generated dependency notices do not replace Aura's content-source disclosures.
`ProviderDisclosure.kt` remains the source of truth for provider policy rows
such as YouTube, Reddit, Pexels, Pixabay, community uploads, bundled media, and
AI-generated content. Settings > Open source licenses links users to the latest
release notice artifacts while keeping provider disclosures visible in-app.

## Raw Google OSS inputs

`GOOGLE-OSS-RAW-INPUTS.zip` preserves the exact generated files used by the
markdown converter and dependency notice lock:

- `dependencies.json`
- `third_party_license_metadata`
- `third_party_licenses`
- `MANIFEST.json`

The manifest records source paths, file sizes, and SHA-256 digests for each raw
input. Keep this archive beside `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` in tagged GitHub
Releases so future drift reviews can inspect the raw Google OSS output without
rerunning Gradle.

## Native compliance packet

`NATIVE-COMPLIANCE.md` is a factual inventory, not legal advice. It records
artifact hashes, ABI payload paths, nested yt-dlp/Python facts, FFmpeg payload
entries, and upstream source/build references that release owners must review.

`docs/legal/ffmpeg-source-correspondence.md` is the FFmpeg-specific release
review checklist. It records the resolved FFmpeg AAR hash, nested
`libffmpeg.zip.so` hashes, embedded FFmpeg configure lines, the FFmpeg source
candidate, and remaining owner actions for source correspondence.

Treat a youtubedl-android, NewPipeExtractor, yt-dlp, Python, QuickJS, or FFmpeg
version change as a required native packet refresh. When FFmpeg payload facts
change, refresh `docs/legal/ffmpeg-source-correspondence.md` in the same change
and keep the unresolved-owner-action section accurate.

## Gradle dependency verification

Gradle checksum metadata is committed at `gradle/verification-metadata.xml`.
Regenerate it only during a dependency-resolution maintenance pass.

Use Android Studio's bundled JBR:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:/Program Files/Android/Android Studio/jbr"
.\gradlew.bat --write-verification-metadata sha256 :app:dependencies --stacktrace --no-daemon
```

Then review and commit the resulting diff. Future dependency changes should
update `gradle/verification-metadata.xml` in the same commit as the version or
catalog change.

## Provider credential release guard

Provider API keys and client IDs are optional user-controlled settings. Public
release builds must not bundle local Pexels, Pixabay, Freesound, SoundCloud, or
Stability values into `BuildConfig`. For local development, a nonblank ignored
`local.properties` provider key fails by default. Use
`--allow-nonblank-local-provider-keys` only for an explicitly internal build
review; public GitHub, Obtainium, and Izzy builds must keep provider defaults
blank and rely on user-entered settings.

After packaging, scan the signed APK with `tools/provider_credential_apk_scan.py`.
The scanner reports property names and APK entries only, not credential values.

## SBOM scope

SBOM generation is deferred until after the N-1 toolchain upgrade because the
Android dependency graph is already scheduled for a large AGP/Gradle/Kotlin/KSP
migration. The deferred decision is checked by [sbom-readiness.md](sbom-readiness.md)
and `tools/sbom_readiness_check.py` so the release evidence floor cannot drift
while Aura waits for the toolchain change.

When N-1 lands, add a CycloneDX or SPDX SBOM lane that covers:

- Gradle plugins and version-catalog dependencies.
- Release runtime dependency graph.
- Native, FFmpeg, and youtubedl-android payloads.
- Release APK/AAB digests and signing certificate fingerprints.

The reviewed candidate artifact names are `SBOM.cyclonedx.json`,
`SBOM.cyclonedx.xml`, and `SBOM.spdx.json`. The chosen artifact should be
included in `SHA256SUMS.txt`, tagged GitHub Release assets, release notes, and
any local provenance evidence supported by the selected format.
