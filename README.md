## What Makes Aura Different

Aura is built as a local-first tool rather than an ad-and-credit marketplace:

| Area | Aura behavior |
|------|---------------|
| **Advertising** | No ad SDK, sponsored placements, or cross-app tracking. |
| **Account** | Browsing, downloading, editing, applying, and backing up content do not require an Aura account; community features use an anonymous app identity. |
| **Credits and paywalls** | No Aura credit balance, subscription, or in-app paywall. In full builds, optional Stability AI generation uses the user's own provider key and may consume Stability credits. |
| **AI-generated content** | Generation is off by default in full builds and omitted from FOSS builds. Declared AI uploads are labeled, Aura-generated uploads are labeled automatically, and community feeds provide a Hide AI filter. |
| **Offline library** | Downloads and offline favorites stay on the device for local use. Missing or moved files keep their library metadata and can be relinked. Portable backups carry the local media identity and technical details without exporting private paths or media bytes. |

- **Sounds that work offline**: 25 Aura Originals ship with the app, then quality-ranked YouTube results add more ringtones, notifications, and alarms when connected.
- **Reddit-first discovery**: mobile wallpaper and motion communities lead the home feeds, with real cached Atom cursor pagination instead of a fixed recent slice.
- **Video wallpapers from multiple sources**: browse Reddit live wallpapers and cinemagraphs first, followed by YouTube and optional Pixabay or Pexels results. Local video and GIF import includes loop, crop, Fill, and Fit Canvas controls.
- **More ways to personalize**: Reddit RSS leads the network feeds. Wallhaven, Bing, Pexels, Pixabay, YouTube, Aura Originals, local files, and community uploads add user-controlled choices.
- **Fast, bounded feeds**: Discover metadata and a 256 MB image disk cache make repeat visits immediate, while the foreground bitmap cache stays capped at 12.5 percent of app memory.
- **Performance proof path**: Baseline Profile and Macrobenchmark tests cover startup, Wallpaper Detail, and the main media grids during local physical-device checks.
- **5 bottom nav tabs**: Wallpapers, Videos, Sounds, Library, Settings.

## Installing Aura

Every release ships one APK per CPU architecture plus a universal one, and a
single `SHA256SUMS.txt` covering all of them, on the same
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/Aura/releases).

Pick the one that matches your phone. Almost every Android phone made since 2017
is `arm64-v8a`, and that build is roughly a third the size of the universal one
because it carries native code for one architecture instead of four. `armeabi-v7a`
is for older 32-bit devices; the `x86` builds are for emulators. If you are not
sure, the universal APK installs anywhere. Obtainium picks the right one on its
own with `autoApkFilterByArch` enabled, which the bundled
[`obtainium.json`](obtainium.json) already sets.

Do not install debug or third-party re-signed builds.

FOSS store builds omit the Stability AI generator, its provider key field, and
Firebase-backed community features. Full GitHub builds retain those optional
features, with generation disabled until the user enables it and accepts its
disclosure.

Verify the download, then install or update it with ADB:

```powershell
Get-FileHash .\Aura-vX.Y.Z-versionCode-N-arm64-v8a-release.apk -Algorithm SHA256
adb install --user 0 -r .\Aura-vX.Y.Z-versionCode-N-arm64-v8a-release.apk
```

Compare the printed digest with `SHA256SUMS.txt` before installing. The `-r`
update keeps app data only when the installed app and new APK use the same
signing certificate. If Android reports a signature mismatch, obtain the
official matching Aura build; uninstalling would erase local app data.

Official Aura builds are signed with this certificate:

```text
SHA-256: F2:8E:44:BE:A3:2F:5B:28:90:C8:26:8B:7F:BE:D4:3C:44:A4:D6:71:A5:12:FB:07:EB:F1:8F:DD:41:C6:6E:5A
```

Every release since v6.38.1 carries it. Check it with
`apksigner verify --print-certs <apk>` or with
[AppVerifier](https://github.com/soupslurpr/AppVerifier) before installing a
build you did not download from Aura's own releases page. A different digest
means a re-signed APK, whatever the version number says.

Android's developer-verification rollout begins on September 30, 2026 for
participating stores in Brazil, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, then expands
globally in 2027. Unregistered APKs remain installable through ADB. Android is
also launching a one-time advanced flow in August 2026 for power users who
enable developer mode, acknowledge the security warnings, and complete its
24-hour waiting period. Follow the on-device advanced flow when the normal
package installer declines an unregistered APK; the wait does not apply to ADB.
See Android's [verification FAQ](https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides/faq)
and Aura's [verification decision record](docs/distribution/developer-verification.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/Aura.git
cd Aura
```

Open in Android Studio and run. Core browsing works out of the box; optional provider keys can be added later in Settings or `local.properties`.

YouTube extraction works without account credentials. For networks where YouTube
requires proof-of-origin tokens, Settings > Sounds > YouTube PO token provider
accepts the credential-free HTTPS base URL of a self-hosted
[bgutil provider](https://github.com/Brainicism/bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider). Aura
ships its hash-pinned yt-dlp plugin but sends attestation data only after this
optional URL is configured; see yt-dlp's [PO Token Guide](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide).

Choosing **Update yt-dlp** in Settings downloads a replacement executable at
runtime. Aura requires a separate confirmation that explains this bypasses
F-Droid or other repository review checks before the download can start.

## Privacy

Aura has no ads, no subscription, and no cross-app tracking. The public privacy
policy is tracked at [docs/privacy/privacy-policy.md](https://github.com/SysAdminDoc/Aura/blob/main/docs/privacy/privacy-policy.md);
the same link is available in Settings > About > Privacy policy.

## External Automation

Aura exposes two optional broadcast actions for Tasker, MacroDroid, adb, and
Termux users:

```text
com.chloemlla.aura.action.ROTATE_NOW
com.chloemlla.aura.action.SHUFFLE_NOW
```

Enable them in Settings > Wallpaper rotation > External automation before
sending broadcasts. Aura ignores external broadcasts by default, accepts at most
one every 30 seconds, and records the last action plus the optional
`com.chloemlla.aura.extra.CALLER_PACKAGE` diagnostic extra in Settings > Diagnostics.
Broadcasts only enqueue the existing rotation worker, so charging, Wi-Fi, idle,
battery, Doze, and WorkManager quota can still delay the wallpaper change.
The same one-shot path powers the optional **Next wallpaper** Quick Settings
tile. Add it from Android's tile editor; its active state mirrors automatic
rotation, while tapping it still queues one wallpaper change when scheduling is off.

## Building

Requires JDK 21 and Android SDK 37. Android Studio Quail 2 (2026.1.2) or later recommended.

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug      # use gradlew.bat on Windows
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
./gradlew lintDebug
./gradlew assembleFullRelease  # GitHub/Obtainium APK; requires signing config
./gradlew -PauraReleaseChannel=play bundleFullRelease  # Play AAB; run separately
```

> Always use the included Gradle wrapper. It pins Gradle 9.5.0, which is what AGP 9.3.1 needs.

The legacy Android test lane runs against release-minified Full and FOSS APKs. It
opens Sounds and exercises NewPipe search on API 26, 27, and 29 without requiring
network access. Build its target and test APKs with:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat -PauraInstrumentationBuildType=release `
    :app:assembleFullRelease :app:assembleFossRelease `
    :app:assembleFullReleaseAndroidTest :app:assembleFossReleaseAndroidTest
```

Run debug build, unit tests, lint, signed APK/AAB dry runs, checksum checks, and release metadata guards locally before publishing.
Debug builds include Android pseudolocales; the route screenshot gate covers compact English XA and Arabic XB RTL fixtures. Simplified Chinese ships as a real translation pack since v6.45.1.

Copy `local.properties.example` to `local.properties` for local SDK, optional API keys, and release signing values. Release variants force local provider keys blank, so development credentials cannot be packaged by mistake. Public releases are built locally as signed, non-debuggable APK/AAB artifacts, verified with `apksigner`, checked against `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and uploaded to GitHub Releases for GitHub/Obtainium users. See [release signing docs](docs/distribution/release-signing.md), the [distribution channel strategy](docs/distribution/channel-strategy.md), [alternative-store disclosures](docs/distribution/alt-store-metadata.md), [release metadata consistency](docs/distribution/release-metadata-consistency.md), [SBOM readiness](docs/distribution/sbom-readiness.md), [store asset planning](docs/distribution/store-assets.md), [Android developer verification prep](docs/distribution/developer-verification.md), and [supply-chain verification](docs/distribution/supply-chain.md).

After committing a release candidate, verify its exact tracked tree with:

```powershell
python tools\release_clean_clone_check.py --repo-root . --revision HEAD
```

This runs the source-backed release, documentation, and legal gates in an
isolated archive. Signing keys, generated release artifacts, console checks,
publication, and device evidence are reported separately as owner-only pass,
fail, or unknown results.

To verify the FOSS release lane reproducibly, start from a clean checkout and run:

```powershell
python tools\foss_reproducibility_check.py --build-twice --output-dir build\reproducibility
```

The check copies only Git-tracked inputs into two isolated source roots, fixes the
build epoch, disables release signing, serializes R8, and requires matching raw and
signature-stripped archive evidence. The resulting APKs are verification artifacts,
not public install packages. Existing independently built APKs can be compared with
`--first-apk <path> --second-apk <path>`.
